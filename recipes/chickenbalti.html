        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spiced chicken balti, this Indian takeaway classic is characteristically a meat (or veg) dish with a thick, spicy tomato-based sauce. Usually, it's heavy on the chilli heat with a little tanginess from the yoghurt that's added.</p>

            <li>400g can chopped tomato</li>
            <li>1l chicken stock</li>
            <li>50g roasted salted cashew</li>
            <li>small bunch coriander , leaves chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A foolproof brownie recipe for a squidgy chocolate bake.</p>
    <p>This is my absolute favorite brownie recipe. They are rich, fudgy in the middle, and made completely from scratch. These brownies are so much better than the box, and I bet you have what you need to make them already sitting in your kitchen.</p>
